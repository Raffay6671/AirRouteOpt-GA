AirRouteOpt-GA: Aircraft Route Optimization using Genetic Algorithms
Overview
AirRouteOpt-GA is a sophisticated system designed to optimize flight routes for commercial aircraft using Genetic Algorithms (GAs). This project tackles the complex challenges faced by the aviation industry, such as minimizing operational costs, reducing fuel consumption, and enhancing passenger satisfaction while adapting to real-time changes in weather conditions and air traffic.

Features

Route Optimization: Utilizes a GA-based algorithm to find optimal routes considering various operational constraints.

Fitness Function: Includes a custom fitness function that integrates aircraft performance metrics with real-time environmental data.

Simulation Environment: Features a simulation environment to test the algorithm against dynamic weather patterns and traffic scenarios.

Visualization Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface to visualize optimized routes and key performance indicators, enhancing the interpretability of the optimization process.

Technologies

Python: For implementing the Genetic Algorithm and handling data processing.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive algorithm development and testing.

HTML/CSS: For developing the visualization interface.

Flask: To serve the application and manage the backend operations.
